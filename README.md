# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vili! Entrepreneur, student, investor and an amateur guitarist.

Throughout my journey of becoming a programmer, I've mostly worked with Python, TypeScript, React and Node. However, I am actively branching out into different things such as Svelte, Rust and Kotlin to name a few. I'm always eager to learn and develop, whether it be programming or day-to-day life skills.

Through twists and turns of life I've also come to somewhat fluently speak PHP (more than I'd like to ðŸ˜…), WordPress and the WP ecosystem.
