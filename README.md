# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vili! Entrepreneur, student, investor and an amateur guitarist.

Throughout my journey of becoming a programmer, I've mostly worked with **Python**, **TypeScript**, **React** and **Node**. However, I am actively branching out into different languages and frameworks such as Svelte, Rust, Haskell and Kotlin to name a few. I'm always eager to learn and develop, whether it be programming or day-to-day life skills.
